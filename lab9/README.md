Description: In this lab assignment, we are recreated the report that we wrote in homework 2 using LaTex. This is important to learn because in many scientific journals and publications, outputs are generated via LaTex.

* Images: This folder contains all of my plots in both .png and .pdf form.
* Lab9.Rnw: This file contains all the code that I wrote to generate the Lab9.pdf. In this file, it contains the content of my report from homework2 from this class.
